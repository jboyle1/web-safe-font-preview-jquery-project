## Web Safe Font Preview App(jQuery Project)

### Description

I decided to complete this Codecademy jQuery project in my code editor rather than the online portal to get a more holistic understanding of the file and DOM linkage. I used the supplied source code and completed the steps using Github version control to commit documentation. Here is the project description:

While there are many fonts you can purchase and add to your site, there are also several free, web safe fonts that work across all browsers. I will build a simple app to preview different web safe fonts, sizes, and weights.
